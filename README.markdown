# Slider fun

A simple ES6 slider javscript function.

The goal was to build a simple slider function that attaches a handle and switches between open/closed with a css class. There cannot be a wrapper since that might interfere with the rest of the html layout and it should not make opionated decisions about what css to use, especially not display since that might interfere with flexbox layouts.

If you want to load the slider as initially open, just add the `open` class to the slider.
